# The IndieWeb Movement (2019)

## Why

- Ownership
  - The IndieWeb is mostly about taking control of your content, owning your data through Open Source and Standards.
  - Platforms like Medium and Twitter are [[tk-silos]]—you don't own what you publish on these websites.
  - A principle of the IndieWeb is to own your data by publishing first on your personal website—and possibly syndicating to these other platforms.
- Break free from silos, as they are:
  - Proprietary
  - Usually for profit
  - Might disappear (with your data)
- Identity
  - When reading an article on Medium, you don't notice the author. You might remember the article but not its author.
  - When publishing to your own website, you center your content creation around yourself. There is less dissociation between your thoughts and your identity.
- Political statement
  - Being on the IndieWeb is a political statement saying "we don't trust / want your platform".
