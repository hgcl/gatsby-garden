# How Technology Grows (2018)

- Broaden the way we understand the term “technology”. Not only digital and computing.
- [[three-forms-of-technology]]:
  - Tools
    - eg. pots, pans, screwdriver
  - Instructions
    - eg. recipes
  - Process knowledge
    - Tacit knowledge, know-how, technical experience, built with time
    - > Process knowledge is the kind of knowledge that’s hard to write down as an instruction. You can give someone a well-equipped kitchen and an extraordinarily detailed recipe, but unless he already has some cooking experience, we shouldn’t expect him to prepare a great dish.
    - In [[§technology-as-process-2020]], Maggie Appleton describes it as “So tacit knowledge, you know, embodied knowledge, but sort of at a community scale, how do a whole group of people hold communal knowledge together.”
- Specialization caused many countries to lose process knowledge
  - Searching for comparative advantage
  - Many developed countries specialized in services > manufacturing / industrial
  - Losing know-how in consequence, not easy to gain back
- Specialization and separation hindered innovation
  - > Knowledge should circulate throughout the supply chain, flowing both up and down the stack. Successful industries tend to cluster into tight-knit production networks. The easiest way to appreciate the marvel of clusters is to look at Silicon Valley, where capital, academia, a large pool of eager labor, and companies both large and small sit next to each other. To any of us who have spent some time in Silicon Valley, it’s obvious that this concentration of economic linkages is part of the magic that makes the system work.
  - Process knowledge is a necessity for technological advancement
  - Andy Grove, former Intel CEO, explaining what happened when manufacturing left the US: “we broke the chain of experience that is so important in technological innovation.”
- Investing too much in service industry results, doesn‘t help
  - > Too many service jobs are meant to cancel out the efforts of other service jobs, for example in litigation, where a plaintiff’s lawyer creates a job for the defendant’s lawyer. And often the zero-sumness is asymmetric: a dozen hackers make a theft, and companies everywhere subsequently need to spend collective billions on staff or contractors to protect themselves
- Examples of innovations outside of the digital sphere
  - > What are some of the things I’m looking for? For starters: energy too cheap to meter; colonies on Mars and beyond; re-forestation of our deserts; nanotechnology that lets us print basic materials; medical devices and pharmaceuticals that prevent, treat, or cure most ailments; a deeper understanding of materials; and so many other things. To make these all happen, we need to have the development of a lot more tools and machinery.

> Industrial deepening leads to science fiction that is optimistic, while digital proliferation pushes it towards dystopia.
