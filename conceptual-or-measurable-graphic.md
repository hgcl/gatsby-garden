# Conceptual or Measurable Graphic

In data visualization, graphics are classified along two axis. "Conceptual or measurable" refers to the first axis—the second axis being [[explanatory-or-exploratory-graphic]].

This first axis describes to the nature of your raw data or message. 

Are they statistics, numbers or quantities? If so, your data is *measurable*. You can  easily translate it into charts.

On the other side, your data might not be measurable but more *conceptual*. It might  be necessary to use illustrations to translate it into a visual message.
