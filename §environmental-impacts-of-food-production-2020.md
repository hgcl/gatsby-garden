# Environmental Impacts Of Food Production (2020)

## Key facts

- In this study emissions = GHG (Green House Gas) emissions [[tk-ghg-emissions]]
- This is data from the largest meta-analysis of global food systems to date, published in Science by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018).
  - 38000 farms, 119 countries.

## Eating local?

[[eating-vegan-is-better-for-the-environment-than-eating-local]]

- Supply chains (= everything after food has been produced) accounts up to 18% of emissions only
  - 80% of emissions come from land use + farm processes (= everything before supply chains)
- Transport emissions = 6% of emissions globally
- Eating locally can even be harmful if produces are not seasonal:
  - Example: tomatoes from greenhouses in Sweden = 10 times as much energy as importing tomatoes from Southern Europe where they were in-season
- Impact of transport is usually small in terms of emissions, except for air-freighted produces
  - Perishable food that needs to be eaten fast after harvest is usually air-freighted. E.g. berries, green beans, asparagus
- What about low-impact producers?
  - No difference => plant-based foods emit fewer greenhouse gases than meat and dairy, regardless of how they are produced.
  - The worst producers of plant proteins (e.g. tofu, nuts, beans, peas) are still better than the best meat producers—very little overlap between the two.

## Actions

[[considerations-for-a-lower-carbon-diet]]

- It’s better to eat avocados from across the globe rather than cheese / meat
- If you want a lower-carbon diet, eating less meat is nearly always better than eating the most sustainable meat.
  - The worst producers of plant proteins are still better than the best meat producers
- Buying locally can even be harmful if the product is not seasonal (energy-intensive production methods needed) [[buying-local-food-can-be-harmful-for-the-environment]]
- Don’t buy perishable food (e.g. berries, green beans, asparagus) that come from far away = by plane
