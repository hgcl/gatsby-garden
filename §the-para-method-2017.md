# The PARA Method (2017)

*Created by [[tiago-forte]]*

- Overview of the [[p-a-r-a-method]] 
  - P.A.R.A. stands for Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives
  - It is an organizational method for life and work created by Tiago Forte
  - > P.A.R.A. preserves and actually enhances the most important distinction that any productivity system must make: between actionable and non-actionable information
- Projects
  - “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline”
  - eg. Create the Onboarding Guide, Complete app mockup, Write blog post
  - A project is made of one or several tasks
    - eg. Write blog post => Do research — Write first draft — SEO — etc.
- Areas of Responsibility
  - “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time”
  - Important: it has no deadline, can never be completed. It has a standard to be maintained.
  - eg. Health, Finances, Personal Development, Become a better manager, etc.
- Resources
  - “a topic or theme of ongoing interest”
  - eg. habit formation, project management, transhumanism, coffee, etc.
  - Some people use the “Resources” section to store all resources, links, notes and assets that are needed by projects or tasks
- Archive
  - “inactive items from the other three categories”
- PARA in use
  - Daily: display tasks and projects
  - Weekly: 
    - Need a broader view for a weekly review => display areas of responsibility as well
    - > Are you currently meeting the standard you’ve set for yourself in each of the areas you’re committed to?
  - Monthly: have a look at resources as well
- Projects, Dreams & Hobbies
  - > [A] project without a corresponding goal is known as a “hobby.” If you’re not committed to or haven’t fully articulated the outcome you want, you must be doing it just for fun.
    >
    > And if you have a goal without a corresponding project, that’s called a “dream.” You may desire it with all your heart and soul, but without an active project, you are not in fact currently making any progress.
