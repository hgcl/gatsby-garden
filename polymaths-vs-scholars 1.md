# Polymaths vs Scholars

The key differentiation between a [[polymath]] and a scholar is the application of learnings ([[salman-ansari]]).

A polymath uses what he learns from varied fields to connect ideas and solve problems in real life. 

A scholar learns for the sake of learning, it is an end in itself.
