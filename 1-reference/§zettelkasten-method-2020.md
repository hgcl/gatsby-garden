## Info

- Topics: [[zettelkasten-method]]
- References: [[§how-to-take-smart-notes-2017]]

## Questions

- What was the first source for this article?

## Notes

- [[fleeting-notes]]
  - FN are reminders of ideas and concepts
  - FN must follow at least one of 2 criteria:
    - You want to remember this idea permanently
    - You want to use the idea in your work
  - Always reference the source and author
  
- [[literature-notes]]
  - After filtering out the fleeting notes that speak to me, I get my LN
  - Elaborate those FN—those reminders—into a paragraph that fully describes the idea
  - Write it as if writing to someone else
  - LN follow 4 criteria:
    - LN should be written in your own words
    - Written in a way that you understand it in 10 years
    - 1 note = 1 idea
    - Include reference (Last Name, year, pp.22) inline and complete source at the bottom
      - eg. Ahrens, S. (2017). How to take smart notes: One simple technique.
  
- [[permanent-notes]] 
  - PN vs. LN
    - LN written in the context of the **source**. PN written in context of **your own ideas and interests**.
    - LN have one connection (= source). PN can have many.
  - 1 note = 1 idea, as it is easier to connect with other ideas

- how to connect permanent notes, examples: 
  - A term mentioned in a note which links to a term definition note.
  - An author mentioned in a note which links to an author biography note.
  - A note which directly contradicts findings in a note that contains a fact, study, opinion.
  - A note which adds something to the existing note.
  - A personal comment on the idea contained in another note.
  - Use a bridge note
  - Connect with a topic index note

- [[index-notes]]
  - Represents a cluster of PN (that you detect after a while)
  - They are similar to an individual article outline, table of content of an article
  - Created from content that already exists

- Keyword notes
  - An index note = table of content of an article
  - A KN = table of content of a book (= broader topic), eg. art
  - Index notes are often linked inside of KN. Eg. Art (KN) > Art goals (IN)
