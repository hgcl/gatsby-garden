# Types of Notes

My note-taking system is almost fully based on the [[zettelkasten-method]]. 

- [[fleeting-notes]] record transient thoughts and reading notes. 
- [[literature-notes]] are atomic concepts or ideas that stem from these first notesâ€”they are always clearly referencing the original sources. 
- [[permanent-notes]] are original ideas that I form from these foundations. They are also atomic concepts.
- [[index-notes]] are outlines allowing me to structure notes around an idea.
