# Progressive Summarization (2017)

*Method coined by [[tiago-forte]]*

## Knowledge Management Systems

- Tagging-first system
  - > Tagging-first approaches argue that there should be no explicit hierarchy of notes, notebooks, and stacks. Notes are envisioned as an ever-changing, virtual matrix of interconnected, free-floating ideas. Because many tags can be applied to one note, there are multiple pathways to discover any given note. Locating notes in specific notebooks and folders is seen as limiting and static. 
- Notebook-first system
  - > This basically translates how we organize things in the physical world — in a series of discrete containers — into the digital world. 
- Discoverability vs. Understanding
  - Discoverable = making a note digest by compressing it down to its essential
  - Understandable = making a note complete, add context, examples and details
    - If a note is too complex: “The main points and key insights are hidden somewhere in the noise.”

## [[progressive-summarization]]: 5 Layers

- Layer 1 — Notes
  - Full notes and context, very understandable
- Layer 2 — Bold Passages
  - When going back to a note, making bold key sentences, keywords representing the core of the idea
- Layer 3 — Highlighted Passages
  - Highlighting only the “best of the best”, unique
- Layer 4 — Mini-summary
  - Summarizing the key points of the note in your own words
- Layer 5 — Remix
  - > And finally, for a tiny minority of sources, the ones that are so powerful and exciting I want them to become part of how I think and work immediately, I remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them from every angle in layers 1–4, I add my own personality and creativity and turn them into something else.
