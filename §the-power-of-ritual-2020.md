As I started reading _The Power of Ritual_, I wrote a few lines about it in my [15th weekly review](https://clarale.com/blog/15-walk-on-the-frozen-canal):

> [ ... ] they talk about the “unbundling” process—or how spirituality, community and rituals that were once part of religious institutions, are taking on new contemporary forms.
>
> People now find community in their fitness communities, justice groups or workplace. Young people are less and less religious, but still yearn for spirituality—moments infused with meaning and intention.
>
> I have just started his book The Power of Ritual. In it, Casper explains how you can bring back meaning to things you do every day—it might be your brewing coffee routine, meditation or journaling practice. This idea of making things meaningful and intentional really speaks to me and I am looking forward to going back to the book—which doesn’t often happen with nonfiction.

## Unbundling process

  - fragmenting a single collection of diverse offerings into multiple different sources
  - e.g. In the past, newspapers would give you a puzzle, the news, personal ads, letters to the editor. Nowadays, these roles are being replaced by many sources. Candy Crush might replace your puzzle, you will post your ads on Facebook and find your news online. This unbundling process makes the daily paper obsolete.
  - In the mid of the 20th century, most people in Western Europe would rely on their religious community for multiple things: find connection and belonging, practice spirituality, foster healing, inspire morality, mark holidays, support family, work for justice. 
    - It is more difficult to relate with religion for younger generations as “institutions have turned mysteries into dogmas. They've lost the lightness of touch to translate timeless wisdom into relevant teaching.”

## What is spirituality?

- Spirituality is simply moments with deep meaning. It can be very personal and is a choice as to which moments are “sacred” to you.
- What is sacred?
  - There are no sacred vs. secular places or things. E.g. a supermarket has as much potential as a church to be sacred. It depends on how much meaning you _want_ or feel like putting into it. 
  - The Latin word _sacrare_ means to consecrate or dedicate—to declare or make something holy. “The sacredness is in the doing.” Sacred is not simply a status. 
- What is a ritual?
  - Intention, attention, repetition
  - You can add an element of spirituality to it by infusing meaning into it and making it important.

- Tradition vs. convention
  - Convention: boring, formality, no why or connection with oneself
  - Tradition: creative, evolving to our times, nurturing

## Connecting with self
- Gratitude journal
- Sabbath: for solo time, for play and creativity, tech sabbath
- Sacred reading
  - Finding meaning and reflecting on your life experiences with a “sacred book” as a starting point. Casper uses _Harry Potter_ and even has a [sacred reading podcast of it](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/).
  - Four questions:
  > 1. What's literally happening in the narrative? 
  > 2. Where are we in the story? What allegorical images, stories, songs, or metaphors show up for you? 
  > 3. What experiences have you had in your own life that come to mind? 
  > 4. What action are you being called to make? 
  
## Connecting with others
- 
## Connecting with nature
  - Create new traditions
  - Pilgrimage
  - Celebrate passing time: seasons, new moon, following liturgical calendars.

## Connecting with transcendence
- Prayer practice (disconnected from religion): adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication
  - Adoration: beauty of the world, of a song, awe
  - Confession: recognize your life as it is, with shortcomings and without the fluff, find a small confession group(?), recognize fears
  - Thanksgiving: gratefulness, chain of things you are grateful for, can always start with the same (e.g. to be alive)
  - Supplication: wishes, loving-kindness (same 3 intentions for yourself, someone you love, a stranger)

Casper concludes the book with: 
> First, you already have a host of rituals we might call spiritual practices — even if you'd never use that language. Reading, walking, eating, resting, reflecting; these are legitimate and worthy of your attention and care, and they can be the foundation of a life of deep connection. Second, I hope you feel empowered to translate ancient traditions to enrich those modern practices and that you feel permission to be creative in combining the ancient and the emergent.

- Brewing coffee
