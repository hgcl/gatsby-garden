# Don’t Quit Your Day Job (2019)

- [[bifurcation]], a definition: When having a “main career” in a full or part-time job, but also dedicating time on the side to your “true passion”. 
  - IMO: Of course, it doesn’t have to be a passion per se. It could also be something you would rather be doing as a main activity than your full-time job.
- Bifurcating is a compromise between the more stable “having a family and some savings” world and the riskier “following your passion” choice.
-  > I wouldn’t dare to advise young idealists either to follow or not to follow their dreams. At the most, I might advise them to be wary of career preachers, whether radical or conservative, and that, while they shouldn’t fear commitment and leaps of faith, they also shouldn’t fear compromise.
   -  It is okay to not know where you are going, to be in the in-between. The extreme is not necessarily positive.
   -  “Simply follow your passion” preachers might not be much better than their conservative counterparts.
