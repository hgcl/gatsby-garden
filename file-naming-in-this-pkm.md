# File Naming in This PKM

## Filenames

To support [[foam]], the Markdown files in this PKM are named in *kebab-case*. 

- All reference notes begin with a `ยง`.
- [[tk-notes]] titles start with a `tk`.

## Headlines

After its front matter, each note also starts with a headline loosely written in *Title Case*.
