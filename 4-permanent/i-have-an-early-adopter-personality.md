# I Have an Early Adopter Personality

It is right after I adopted several alpha-grade softwares in 2020 that [[robin]] first called me an early adopter type of person.

We laughed it off... until I realized how true it was. I definitely tend to adopt softwares and online services right when discovering them—if they talk to me. I go as far as migrating all my data from one software to another, without much thought for the consequences.

Here are some examples from 2020 alone:
- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [Newslettrs](https://newslettrs.app/)
- [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/)—which quickly replaced [PaperSpan](https://www.paperspan.com/)
