# Stop Speculating About What Is Best

In [[§atomic-habits-2018]], James Clear describes a study with two groups of people in a photography competition. 

The first group was to be judged solely on the numbers of photographs submitted, while the second group would be judged on the excellence of a single image. 

The results? The best pictures were actually taken by the “quantity group”.

When striving for perfection, you might miss the target just because you don’t *know* where or what the target is. You speculate. Experiment more, iterate with a system of feedback-loop to get closer to your objective.
