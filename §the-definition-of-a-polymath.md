# The Definition of a Polymath

In [[salman-ansari]]’s words, a polymath is someone who:

>  - Engages in extended learning in disparate fields, industries and/or skills.
>  - Applies learnings by connecting ideas from different areas to solve problems in unique ways.

The following quote also resonated with me. Do I tend to be a scholar?

> In my view, the key is application of learnings. I think if you’re learning about a ton of fields without applying them in practice, that makes you more of a scholar than a polymath (and more power to you!).
