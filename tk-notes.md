# TK Notes

I first heard of TK—a.k.a. to come—from [[§make-your-notes-work-for-you-2020]]. The article itself refers to the journalistic use of TK to signify that more material will come later&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>.

In [[types-of-notes]], I add the `#tk` tag to notes I create on the fly and don't intend to deepen soon.

What is the difference between [[fleeting-notes]] and TK notes? Fleeting notes are in my inbox and are active work-in-progress. TK notes are not active notes. They are just ideas that might never come to life, as they might never get written at all.
