# File Naming in This PKM

## Filenames

To support [[foam]], the Markdown files in this PKM are named in *kebab-case*. 

All reference notes begin with a `ยง`.

## Headlines

After its front matter, each note also starts with a headline loosely written in *Title Case*.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[foam]: ../4-permanent/foam "Foam"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
