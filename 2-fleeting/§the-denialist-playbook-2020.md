# The Denialist Playbook (2020)

- In the 1950s, more than 200,000 Americans were disabled by the poliovirus.
  - In 1955, a vaccine was finally found. Chiropractors actively opposed the vaccination campaign.
- [[general-argument-patterns-of-denialists]] are the same:
  1. Doubt the Science
  2. Question Scientists’ Motives and Integrity
  3. Magnify Disagreements among Scientists and Cite [[gadflies]] as Authorities
  4. Exaggerate Potential Harm
  5. Appeal to Personal Freedom
  6. Reject Whatever Would Repudiate A Key Philosophy

- Doubt the Science 
  - Either by doubting the entire scientific discipline or with arguments against a specific scientific claim.
  - eg. Chiropractors explained the decrease of polio with other reasons.
  - eg. COVID: doubting threat posed by the coronavirus
- Question Scientists’ Motives and Integrity
  - eg. In vaccination => scientists with conflicting financial interests, manufacturers greed, governor officials controlling the results
- Magnify Disagreements among Scientists and Cite Gadflies as Authorities
  - Differences between scientists are inflated by denialists “to imply a lack of consensus on more fundamental points, while often propounding the contradictory views of a few unqualified outliers”.
  - eg. Chiropractors used the word of one outlier critic to vaccination (Viera Scheibner) even though her expertise was geology, not biology.
  - eg. COVID: belief in alternative treatments over experts
- Exaggerate Potential Harm
  - Incite fear, emphasize potential side-effects
- Appeal to Personal Freedom
  - eg. Against compulsory vaccination, teaching of evolution in public school (freedom of religion)
  - eg. COVID: anti-lockdown
- Reject Whatever Would Repudiate a Key Philosophy 
  - eg. “Chiropractic was founded in the early 20th century on the assertion that all disease has its origins in misalignments of the spine.” >> Germ theory and vaccination goes against this key belief
  - Historian of science Naomi Oreskes calls it “implicatory denial”—*that is to say, we reject scientific findings because we don’t like their implications.*

- > [W]hen people feel a strong connection to a political party, leader, ideology, or belief, they are more likely to let that allegiance do their thinking for them and distort or ignore the evidence that challenges those loyalties. — *Psychologists Elliot Aronson and Carol Tavris in the Atlantic*
