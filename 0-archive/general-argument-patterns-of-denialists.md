# General Argument Patterns of Denialists

[[denialists]] always use the same general pattern of arguments to defend their point of view. We can divide them in six categories:

  1. Doubt the Science
  2. Question Scientists’ Motives and Integrity
  3. Magnify Disagreements among Scientists and Cite [[gadflies]] as Authorities
  4. Exaggerate Potential Harm
  5. Appeal to Personal Freedom
  6. Reject Whatever Would Repudiate A Key Philosophy

## Doubt the Science
A pattern of argument is doubting an entire discipline or a specific scientific claim. 

Examples are:
- chiropractors explaining the decrease of polio—following vaccination—with other reasons
- Covid-19 skeptics doubting the threat of the virus

## Question Scientists’ Motives and Integrity

## Magnify Disagreements among Scientists and Cite Gadflies as Authorities

## Exaggerate Potential Harm

## Appeal to Personal Freedom

## Reject Whatever Would Repudiate A Key Philosophy
