# Talent and Mental Blocks (2020)

This is a tweet from David R. MacIver.

- Talent comes from interest, but mostly from _not_ having emotional blocks.
- There might be naturally talented people—memory, spatial reasoning, etc.—but it should be a last resort explanation for “talent”.
- How many teenagers consider themselves intrinsically by at math?
  - “Gee, it seems we’ve managed to induce crippling anxiety in this person every time they see an equation. I wonder if that has any important consequences? Nah they’re probably just intrinsically bath at math. Some people lack mathematical talent.”
