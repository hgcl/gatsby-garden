# Process Knowledge Is Necessary to Technological Advancement

Process knowledge is one of the [[three-forms-of-technology]].

When embracing the age of specialization and comparative advantage, many developed countries lost their process knowledge on the way. It was easy to deprioritize industries, but it would take a tremendous amount of time and effort to gain back their lost know-how.

The former Intel CEO Andy Grove argues that “[the United States] broke the chain of experience that is so important in technological innovation.” 

Societies tend to innovate more and have strong technology advancements when design and manufacturing are close to each other.

> The easiest way to appreciate the marvel of clusters is to look at Silicon Valley, where capital, academia, a large pool of eager labor, and companies both large and small sit next to each other. To any of us who have spent some time in Silicon Valley, it’s obvious that this concentration of economic linkages is part of the magic that makes the system work.
