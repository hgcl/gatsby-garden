# Buying Local Food Can Be Harmful for the Environment

There is a misconception that eating local is an important factor for a low-carbon diet. Transport emissions of our food is however only 6% of the total food emissions globally.

There are even instances when eating local can be more harmful for the environmentâ€”when using energy-intensive production methods (e.g. greenhouses or long-term refrigeration). 

Here is an example:

> Hospido et al. (2009) estimate that importing Spanish lettuce to the UK during winter months results in three to eight times lower emissions than producing it locally. The same applies for other foods: tomatoes produced in greenhouses in Sweden used 10 times as much energy as importing tomatoes from Southern Europe where they were in-season.
