# Outputs Must Be Aligned With Your Goals

This is one of the three statements of the [[habit-of-progression]] concept.

It is kind of intuitive, but the wrong consistent inputs will lead to unwanted outputs in the long-term. For example, choosing to do a degree that is not aligned with your true career wishes will not truly help you.

To discover what inputs lead to wanted outputs, you can experiment and iterate. A lot.

Find the right habit by intentionally testing out more inputs / outputs dynamics. Iterate monthly, weekly or even daily.
