# Polymath

I use [[salman-ansari]]'s definition of the word polymath in [[§the-definition-of-a-polymath]].

The short version says that *polymath* is a fancy word for *generalist*.

The longer version says that a polymath:
- learns extensively from different fields
- brings those learnings together to solve problems in unique ways
