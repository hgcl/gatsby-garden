# Considerations for a Lower Carbon Diet

Here is a list of diet-related considerations for a lower carbon footprint. They don’t take into account the human aspect into consideration.

- If you want a lower-carbon diet, eating less meat is nearly always better than eating the most sustainable meat. [[tk-the-worst-producers-of-plant-proteins-are-better-than-the-best-meat-producers]]
- It is better to eat fruits from across the globe rather than local cheese / meat.
- Air-freighted food can be worst than meat / cheese. Avoid fresh perishable food (e.g. berries, green beans, asparagus) as there is more chance for it to be imported by plane.
- [[buying-local-food-can-be-harmful-for-the-environment]]—this can be the case if the produce is not seasonal and is produced using energy-intensive methods
