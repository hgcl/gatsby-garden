# Infographics vs Visualizations

In data visualization, graphics can be classified along two axis:
1. First axis—[[conceptual-or-measurable-graphic]]
2. Second axis—[[explanatory-or-exploratory-graphic]]

In general, *visualizations* are used to represent data that is measurable (first axis), such as statistics.

On the other hand, what we call *infographics* are usually explanatory (second axis) and will therefore use illustrations to explain the more conceptual messages. *Note: if a message is too conceptual, it will not be possible to represent it visually at all.*
