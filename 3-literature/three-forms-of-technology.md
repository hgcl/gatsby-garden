# Three Forms of Technology

Technology used to be a lot more than just the computing and digital world. Writing is a technology.

Dan Wang explains that technology can take three forms: tools, instructions and process knowledge.

Tools are simply pots, screwdrivers and phones for instance. They are objects that can be used.

Instructions can be explained. With the kitchen analogy, instructions would be recipes.

Process knowledge is the know-how. It is the tacit knowledge, the technical experience that is built with time.

> Process knowledge is the kind of knowledge that’s hard to write down as an instruction. You can give someone a well-equipped kitchen and an extraordinarily detailed recipe, but unless he already has some cooking experience, we shouldn’t expect him to prepare a great dish.
