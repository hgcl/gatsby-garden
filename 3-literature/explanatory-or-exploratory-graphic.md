# Explanatory or Exploratory Graphic

In data visualization, graphics are classified along two axis. "Explanatory or exploratory" refers to the second axis—the first axis being [[conceptual-or-measurable-graphic]].

While the first axis focuses on the nature of your data, the second axis focuses on what you do with it. 

An *explanatory* graphic will be used to explain or declare some known facts. 

On the other hands, a *exploratory* graphic will be used to investigate a dataset and it usually leads to open interpretations and questions.
