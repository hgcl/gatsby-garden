# We Work to Consume

You don't need as much money as you think to live content. 

A 9–5 job takes most of your time and mental space. Drained at the end of a work day, you are happy to buy your way out of this lack of time and energy. You buy convenience, rewards, a bit of excitement, an escape.

In other words: the more we work, the more it pushes us to consume. The more we consume, the more we have to work to afford it.

Following [[parkinson-s-law]], our consumption level expands to fit our new income.
