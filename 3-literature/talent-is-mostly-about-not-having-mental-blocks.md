# Talent Is Mostly About Not Having Mental Blocks

Talent comes from interest and not having mental blocks. 

How many of us—as students—have complained being bad at a subject or another? I have heard so many times people affirm being “just bad at math / German / insert subject”.

As MacIver tweets:

> Gee, it seems we’ve managed to induce crippling anxiety in this person every time they see an equation. I wonder if that has any important consequences? Nah they’re probably just intrinsically bath at math. Some people lack mathematical talent.
