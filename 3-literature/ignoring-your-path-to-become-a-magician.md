# Ignoring Your Path to Become a Magician

Based on Autotranslucence’s article [[§becoming-a-magician-2018]], here are the steps you need to take to become a magician.

1. Surround yourself with magicians and people you admire.
2. Write down a clear and detailed description of your magician, of your future self. Describe the person you are afraid to say you want to be, as it would sound ridiculous and impossible. 
3. Forget it and let your subconscious mind lead you there.

## About Forgetting

Why forget this idea of the person you want to be? 

It is not so much about forgetting it that is important, but not letting your conscious mind undermine your growth potential. If you let it, your mind will automatically apply the strategies of today, the linear path that you can imagine and speculate. 

Yet, as a magician has a completely different lens, what you need is a lens shift. Not the same old strategies.
