# Eating Vegan Is Better for the Environment than Eating Local

The [[environmental-impacts-of-food-production-2020]] article is based on the biggest meta-analysis of global food systems to date. 

One of its key learnings is that for most foods, 80% of the GHG emissions come from the “creation” of the food phases—land use change and processes at the farm stage. The later supply chain phases—such as processing, transport, retail, packaging—are only responsible for a small percentage of the total emissions.

As a rule of thumb, it is usually better to buy vegetables from across the globe, rather than meat and dairy produces from your local farm. There are even instances when [[buying-local-food-can-be-harmful-for-the-environment]].

This is also true for low-impact producers. The global analysis showed that there was very little overlap between the best meat producers and the worst producers of plant proteins (e.g. tofu, nuts, beans, peas).
