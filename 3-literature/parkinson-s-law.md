# Parkinson's Law

Parkinson's Law states that the more time you have to do a task, the more time you will actually use to complete it.

It was first articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in an essay from 1955 in *The Economist* ([now available online](https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law)).
