# Information Design

> The selection of the presentation method and a layout for the information, taking into account the capabilities and limitations of the visual system, is called information design.
> — Koponen and Hildén, [[§data-visualization-handbook-2020]]

In other words, information design is communicating information visually by selecting, organizing and presenting information in the clearest possible way. 

Communication and the transmission of a chosen message is the focus of information design. Aesthetics of a visual come second and are used solely to support the message.
