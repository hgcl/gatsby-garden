# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten Method was created by [[niklas-luhmann]] in the 20th century.

It consisted of a system of paper cards that were linked to one another in a web of ideas. As each card encompasses only one atomic concept, it can easily be connected to cards about completely different topics.

Luhmann organized his cards by separating them between [[literature-notes]] and [[permanent-notes]]. He also used a consistent referencing method to give a unique ID to each of his notes.

The use of his Zettelkasten over several years allowed Luhmann to develop a [[second-brain]]—or thinking companion.
