When talking about career paths, *bifurcating* is a term created by Maloney in his article [[§dont-quit-your-day-job-2019]].

Bifurcating is the act of dividing your time between a stable job and a side activity—that you would rather pursue as a *main career*.

Bifurcating is a compromise between the more stable “having a family and some savings” world and the riskier “following your passion” choice.

## Is It Bad to Bifurcate?

> I wouldn’t dare to advise young idealists either to follow or not to follow their dreams. At the most, I might advise them to be wary of career preachers, whether radical or conservative, and that, while they shouldn’t fear commitment and leaps of faith, they also shouldn’t fear compromise.

> — *Thomas Maloney*

It is completely fine to not know where you are going, to be in the in-between. “Simply follow your passion” preachers might be as toxic as their too conservative counterparts.
