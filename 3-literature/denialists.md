# Denialists

Denialists are people that refuse to accept empirical evidences in favour of an alternative baseless reality. Denialism is essentially an irrational behavior.

“The motivations and causes of denialism include religion, self-interest (economic, political, or financial), and defence mechanisms meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas.”&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>
