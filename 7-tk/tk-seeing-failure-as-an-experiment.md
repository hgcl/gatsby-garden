# Seeing Failure as an Experiment

(title to review)

Idea born from this thought: I didn't create and fail creating enough in life. I haven't built the habit of being an entrepreneur. Consequence: hard to kick-start and concretize projects, feels like a bigger deal (more stakes) than what it is. Harder to own my life and decisions, stuck in status quo.
