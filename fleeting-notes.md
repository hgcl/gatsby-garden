# Fleeting Notes

A fleeting note is a type of note that is part of the [[zettelkasten-method]].

When reading, watching a documentary, listening to a podcast, you might discover a piece of information you want to remember. It might also be a simple thought unrelated to any source.

When it happens, always make sure to have a space—a fleeting note—to record that idea. It can be on paper or digital.

To determine if the idea is “fleeting note material”, it should follow at least one of two criteria:
1. You wish to remember that idea permanently
2. You want to use that idea in your work (what you create)

Also don’t forget to consistently reference your source.
