# On Laziness (2018)

- Using generalizing words

  - We use generalizing words to describe things. This simplifies things and can change the perception and understanding we have of that thing.
  - eg. lazy: Do we actually use it to describe someone who is really trying to avoid responsibility? Or is it a shorthand to say that X doesn’t have the same cleanliness standards as ourselves / is burnout or sleep-deprived / etc.?

- Underlying meaning
  - We have to be careful with our use of generalizing words as they often have underlying meanings.
  - Eg. lazy = doesn’t do the thing I want that person to do // but it also implies = this person is bad, worth of resent
  - > My one caution is that you should take care about calling other people “lazy” unless you’re really certain that they won’t interpret you as meaning the “bad and horrible” meaning, because it is good to make sure that when you insult people it is deliberate.
