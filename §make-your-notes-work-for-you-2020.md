# Make Your Notes Work for You (2020)

Houtz was struggling creating the [[second-brain]] [[niklas-luhmann]] was describing—a.k.a. a thinking companion. He realized that to foster serendipity and surprising connections, he had to improve his way of making links between notes. 

> Here it is in a nutshell, when possible every note should have at least three types of links. 
>
> 1. A link to a more general idea. If you’re writing about the diet of guinea pigs you might link to the nutritional requirements of rodents in general.
> 2. A link to a more specific idea. Here you could link to protein requirements of guinea pigs.
> 3. A related topic. This could be a lateral leap — guinea pigs as pets, alternate meanings of “guinea pig”, an article on “is a guinea pig a pig?”
